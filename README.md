Made in 2019, in 2 days. Crappy game, but one of my first completed games so I am proud of it. I have decided to archive this since there is no way I would work on it again. And this Github repo doesn't even include the source code, only a few builds. It can be played on my itch.io page. https://vincentjenei.itch.io/

You are - intentionally - a bug. Your wings are broken, and only the queen can repair them! She wont give her services away for free though, so you must explore an adventure map pollinating flowers.



* Including Epic Bosses.

* Weird but intentional bugs.

* And EXTREMELY GOOD MUSIC.
